# InfoGat
Some Network Information Gathering Scripts.

Hello world,

There are multiple information gathering scripts in this path which gather information on 
dns records, dns-zones, tries zone transfer, IP lookup, reverse hostname finder,
scan open ports, whois lookup, public ip lookup and finally google dork.
At some cases you might want to install other packages to run the scripts successfully.

You can use GUI or CLI the choice is yours, however you might want to use pip or so for extra packages.

All the scripts are self explanatory and would not require much introduction with you. So, let the InfoGat begin!

Thanks
Neat
